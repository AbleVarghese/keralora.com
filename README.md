# Keralora — Kerala's spice aura, taken global

**[keralora.com](https://keralora.com)** · In build · Source private (commercial product)

Invite-only B2B spice-trading platform connecting Kerala (India) exporters with Canadian buyers —
operated as buy-sell principal with complete buyer↔seller anonymity.

## The interesting problem

Anonymity **is** the product: buyers and sellers must never discover each other's identity.
That guarantee is enforced at three independent layers — data-access layer, Postgres row-level
security, and document redaction — with a dedicated anonymity test suite that runs in CI and is
allowed to block any release.

## Design principles

- **Config over code** — every business number (margins, deposits, MOQ, FX buffers) is an admin setting; new spices, grades, and trade lanes are rows, not rebuilds
- **Decisions are pre-made** — a full ADR log locks every architectural choice with rationale
- **Real-world operational plan** — incorporation, CFIA/CARM compliance, India export regulation, insurance, payment rails — engineered alongside the software
